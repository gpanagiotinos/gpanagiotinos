## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm George
### JAVASCRIPT DEVELOPER
A highly motivated and hardworking individual, with around 6 years of experience in web applications, able to perform full software development life cycle activities. Those 6 years I worked alongside with logistics companies in Greece and Czech Republic. Using technologies like ReactJS, VueJS, NodeJS, Loopback, SequelizeORM and ExpressJS I am able to perform Full Stack Javascript development. Also I have experience in DevOps (AWS Cloud Services, Azure) and DataBase Management (Oracle, MySQL). Cannot think of my everyday life as a developer without Git and Issue Tracking Software (Jira, Microsoft Teams).
